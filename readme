raid_check is a small Ruby script that uses the 'mail' gem to send email notifications in the event of an error or  warning appearing in a 3ware RAID controller log.

If you use tw_cli to manage your RAID arrays, this should work for you.

Make sure you install the 'mail' gem, found here:

Edit the script where necessary to add the correct credentials for your mail server and email addresses.
